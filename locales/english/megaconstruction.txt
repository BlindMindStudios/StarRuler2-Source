ARTIFICIAL_PLANETOID: Artificial Planetoid
ARTIFICIAL_PLANETOID_DESC: <<
	A fully artificially constructed planetoid, complete with its own atmosphere and gravity field.

	Artificial planetoids produce all their own food and do not need to import it, and can construct large processing plants to satisfy their other levelup requirements. The planetoid can also be upgraded to add more surface space.

CONS_PLANETOID_UPGRADE: Extra Planetoid Layer
CONS_PLANETOID_UPGRADE_DESC: <<
	Add an extra layer of surface space to the artificial planetoid, expanding it and allowing for more buildings to be constructed.

BLD_PLANETOID_LV1: Tier 1 Processing Plant
BLD_PLANETOID_LV1_DESC: <<
	A specialized processing plant that can replace one of the artificial planetoid's tier 1 resource requirements.

BLD_PLANETOID_LV2: Tier 2 Processing Plant
BLD_PLANETOID_LV2_DESC: <<
	A specialized processing plant that can replace one of the artificial planetoid's tier 2 resource requirements.

STARFORGE: Star Forge
STARFORGE_BLURB: Rips apart and absorbs portions of the system's star to generate labor.
STARFORGE_DESC: <<
	A highly advanced construction yard that rips power and material straight from the outer layers of the star.

	Generates 25 labor per minute at the cost of slowly damaging the star in the system it is in. Upgrades can be constructed on the star forge to increase its labor generation as well as the rate at which it damages the star.

	All construction on a Star Forge has a 50% reduction in build cost compared to normal.

>>
CONS_STARFORGE_UPGRADE: Upgrade Star Forge
CONS_STARFORGE_UPGRADE_DESC: <<
	Increase the rate at which the Star Forge generates labor by 25 per minute. This also increases the damage dealt to the system's star while using that labor.

CONS_CANNIBALIZE_PLANET: Cannibalize Planet
CONS_CANNIBALIZE_PLANET_DESC: <<
	Use the Star Forge's matter acquisition beam to completely rip apart an unowned or abandoned planet in this system, gaining ore and stored labor in the process.

	Target uncolonized planet is destroyed, gain 5000 Ore and 250 stored Labor.

VACUUM_TELESCOPE: Vacuum Telescope
VACUUM_TELESCOPE_BLURB: Gives vision over all fleets currently anywhere in deep space.
VACUUM_TELESCOPE_DESC: <<
	By detecting minute fluctuations in the hyperfield corresponding to changes in realspace vacuum energy, clusters of concentrated mass can be pinpointed. This has very little use in solar system gravity wells, as the overwhelming mass of the star creates too much noise to detect any other objects, but can very accurately detect fleets traveling through the vast reaches of deep space, where no other significant clusters of mass exist.

	Gives vision over all fleets currently anywhere in deep space.

RINGWORLD: Ringworld
RINGWORLD_DESC: <<
	An enormous ring constructed around a system's star, with habitable space on the inner surface of the ring, facing the star.

	Ringworlds have [levels=$1;#ffb4b6]+0/+10/+20/+30/+40/+50[/levels] increased maximum population.

	For each resource type, if the ringworld is receiving any pressure at all for that resource, it gains [levels=$1;#ffb4b6]2/4/6/8/10/12[/levels] extra pressure of that resource.
